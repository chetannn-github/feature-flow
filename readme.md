✔ Safely rollout or rollback features in production
✔ Integrate easily into React applications using the provided SDK

## 🚀 Who should use it?

This platform is for:
✔ Developers managing feature toggles
✔ Teams requiring environment-specific configurations
✔ Organizations that want controlled rollouts and testing in production

## ⚙️ How it works – Developer Guide
